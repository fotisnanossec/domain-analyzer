## üöÄ Installation and Setup

#### 1\. Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed and available in your system's PATH:

  * **Python 3.x**
  * `whois`
  * `dig` (part of `dnsutils` on Debian/Ubuntu)
  * `nmap`
  * `openssl`
  * `curl`

#### 2\. Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3\. Configuration

Edit the `config.toml` file to point to your local LLM API server. For example, if you are using LM Studio, configure the `host` and `model` as follows:

```toml
[llm]
host = "192.168.0.52:1234"
model = "mistral-nemo-instruct-2407"
timeout = 4800

[paths]
reports_dir = "reports"
```

## üíª Usage Examples

### **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

#### Basic Domain Analysis
```bash
# Analyze a domain for security posture assessment
python main.py example.com

# Analyze an IP address for infrastructure reconnaissance  
python main.py 192.168.1.100
```

#### Mock Data Testing (Training & Demonstration)
```bash
# Generate report from vulnerable site simulation
python main.py --mock-data vulnerable

# Test with secure configuration scenario
python main.py --mock-data secure
```

### **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
```bash
# Launch interactive analysis interface
python main.py --gui
```

The GUI provides real-time status updates, detailed result visualization, and professional report generation suitable for stakeholder presentations.

### **Professional Usage Scenarios**

#### SOC Analyst Workflow
```bash
# Threat hunting investigation
python main.py suspicious-domain.com

# Incident response reconnaissance
python main.py compromised-site.org

# IOC validation and enrichment
python main.py malicious-ip-address
```

#### Vulnerability Assessment Integration
```bash
# External attack surface enumeration
python main.py target-organization.com

# Third-party security validation
python main.py vendor-portal.com

# Continuous monitoring baseline
python main.py corporate-assets.com
```
