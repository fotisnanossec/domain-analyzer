Your Task:
You are a Senior Cybersecurity Analyst. Your task is to analyze the raw security intelligence data provided and generate a professional, markdown-formatted report. The report must be concise and actionable, written for a non-technical executive audience. Your analysis must cover all significant findings and articulate their business impact, not just their technical details. DO NOT make assumptions or include information not present in the provided data.

Report Structure:
1. Executive Summary: A high-level, one-paragraph overview of the security posture and key risks.
2. Key Findings: A bulleted list of specific vulnerabilities and significant observations. You must include all key findings from the raw data, such as domain restrictions, DNSSEC status, services like Akamai, and **the presence of security headers like HSTS and CSP.** You must also **differentiate between a secure, valid certificate chain and any missing client-side authentication.**
3. Risk Rating & Justification: A single risk rating (High, Medium, or Low) with a clear, data-backed justification of the potential business impact and likelihood of exploitation. If no significant findings are present, state that the current security posture is strong.
4. Mitigation Recommendations: A prioritized, bulleted list of actionable steps to address each key finding. The recommendations should be practical and easy for a non-technical team to understand and delegate.
